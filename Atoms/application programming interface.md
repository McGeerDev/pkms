# Application Programming Interface

Application:
> A program or piece of software designed to fulfil a particular purpose.

Programming:
> The process or activity of writing computer programs

Interface: 
> An interface is a connection point where two systems, clients, organisations, meet and interact with one another.





Real world examples of interfaces:
- Wall socket connects the user to the electrical grid so that we have a way of interacting with the electrical grid. If we plug a kettle into the socket, we use only a part of the entire electrical grid and the wall socket allows us to do so. Within certain parameters.
- TV remotes connect the user to the the television so he/she can select channels
- Wifi is an interface that connects IOT devices to the internet.
