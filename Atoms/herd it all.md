### Summary
This is a game where you are a shepherd and you should herd sheep into different pens for sheering. Multiplayer: add teamwork.
The game should be built on a ridiculously efficient/fast engine. 

#### Concepts
[[boids]] - The sheep should bundle together and move naturally in a herd.


### Tools
- [[sockets]] - Use websockets to host the game online [socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- [[module bundler]] - Use [snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) to bundle [[front-end]] modules 
- [[gRPC]] - Use nest with [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) for the [[back-end]]
